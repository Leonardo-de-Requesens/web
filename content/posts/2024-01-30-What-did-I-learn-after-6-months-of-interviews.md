So I was laid off on 2023-07 and started to interview for junior positions at different companies, from Chile and US, this process took me 26h01m+ (only in calls and interviews, I didn't record how much time I studied) and this is what I learned:

### 1. There are positions in the job market but...
Most companies want a senior for the price of a junior, with 5+ years of experience in their stack and with a lot of different skills, something like 3 persons in one.

### 2. The interview process for SWE is long and stressful
In my experience for junior jobs you are going to get 1+ interviews for behavioral questions, 2+ coding interviews and sometimes a system design interview. I can only imagine how many interviews has some of the most seniors positions.
After all this if you are still in the process, congratulations, you will **maybe** get an offer!.

### 3. The ghosting game
So the first time that this happened was really weird but after some time I got the pattern:
- You enter an interview with someone with low seniority
- You are going to get some simple coding questions with the possibility of system design questions, the interviewer will praise you A LOT, so you will feel very confident that you are going to the next round
- The interviewer will tell you the next steps and probably will say something specific like "you are going to get an email from XX for your next interview"
- No one will contact you and if you reach out they will not respond

This happened a few time and I was able to learn when the interview was going no where.

### 4. Where is MY feedback
I interviewed with 13 companies (excluding my current one), only three of them gave me feedback after I was not selected, the other ones just didn't respond when I ask them and some of them sent me a few email to give them feedback to them, because they really care about the process...
